# Python
This year I am working on scripting python using a raspberry pi. Below you will find my completed scripting challenges this year. 

## hello world
The purpose of this assignmet was to print "Hello world." in a loop 5 times. 
### Code:

## Python Program 01, Calculator
The purpose of this assigment was to input variables, and use function to calculate some things.
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/python_calculator_spicy.py
### Screenshot:
![Calculator](https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/calcss.png)
I got a very nice refresher on python scripting with this assignment. I learned how to use inputs, had some practice with functions, and learned alot of foundation material for the next assignments. This was a fun assignment and I learned a lot. 

## Python Program 02, Quadratic Solver
The purpose of this assignemtn was to input variables for a, b, and c in relation to a quadratic function, and have it solve for the roots of the function. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/quadratic_solver.py
### Screenshot:

This assignment introduced me to the idea of somewhat complex mathematics being integrated into a script. I learned a lot about functions in this assignment. This assignment was fun and helpful for future assignments.

## Python Program 03, Strings and Loops
The purpose of this assignment was to create a script that broke a string into individual letters with a "-" replacing breaks. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/strings_and_loops.py
### Screenshot:
![Strings and Loops](https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/stringsloopsss.png)
In strings and loops, I got a lot of practice condensing my script in to as little lines as possible. I learned a lot about strings and implementing loops into other code. The goal was to get it into as few lines as possible, and I got it into 3. This was a fun assignment and taught me a lot about to use of for loops. 

## Python Challenge, Hangman Script
The purpose of this assignment was to create a working hangman game script. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/hangman_script.py
### Screenshot:
![Hangman](https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/hangmanss.png)
I put together all of the fundamentals that I had learned in the previous assignments and larned some more about functions, printing strings, and other various scripting elements in this assignment. I learned more about the process of making longer and more complex scripts too.

## Double LED blink
The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use GPIO pins and make LEDS blink using the RPi.
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/doubleblink.py
### Reflection:
This assigment tought me how to manipulate real world bojects such as LEDs uding the Raspberry Pi. This also tought me how to script real world objects in Python without using CircuitPython. This assigment will be very helpful in the future for our Pi in the Sky project later this year. +

## Acceleration + OLED script
The purpose of this assignment was to create a script that used data from an accelerometer and displayed it on an oled screen.
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/AccelerationScreen.py
### Reflection:
This assignment tought me how to use an accelerometer and an OLED display with my pi. This is extremely helpful because we are going to implement an accelerometer in our project this year. This assignment also tought me more about how helpful example scripts can be for figuring out how something foreign to you interfaces with the hardware you are using.

## Acceleration bubble script
The purpose of this assignment was to create a graphical display of the accelerometer's readings that visibly show the x and y acceleration values on some sort of graph. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/acceleration_bubble.py
### Reflection:
This assignment taught me more about ising the oled screen including how to use different shapes, and positioning things on the oled screen. I also learned how to get scripts to run instantly when booting up the pi. This is going to be very helpful in the future with our pi in the sky project.

### Camera Test 1 and 2
The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to operate the pi's camera using a python script.
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/camera_test_01.py
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/camera_test_02.py
### Reflection:
This assignment taught me how to use the pi's camera using a python script. I also learned how to change to different camera effects. This assignment will help us in the future when we are trying to use the camera module for our pi in the sky project.

### Push Button Stop Motion
The purpose of this assignment was to create a push button stop motion animation using the raspberry pi and python. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/StopMotion.py
### Reflection:
This assignment tought me more about how to use the raspberry pi's camera. This assignment also tought me how to make animations and turn things into mp4s using terminal. This assignment will be very helpful in the future for our pi in the sky project.

# OnShape CAD
This year we are lucky enough to use an amazing program called OnShape for our CAD work. This is a completely cloud based CAD software. These are my CAD assignments for the 2021-22 year.

## CAD Test, Swing Arm
In this assignment, we were tasked to design a part in onshpae only using drawings as a reference. We then tested the mass of the object to see if we designed the part correctly. 
### Screenshot of Swing Arm:
![Swing Arm](https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/CAD/SwingArmSS.png)
I was successful in all stages of the OnShape challenge. Through this assignment I learned a lot about how powerful drawings are (when dimensioned) and learned how to use them as reliable references. This was also a very nice refresher for CAD and OnShape.

## Extra CAD test, Tool Block
In this optional assignment, we were tasked to create 3 variations of an object based on dimensioned drawings alone. We tested whether our parts were correct or not by measuring the mass of the part with a given material.
### Screenshots of Tool Blocks:
Tool block 1:

Tool block 3:

I succesfully completed all of them. In this assignment I expanded my knowledge on using drawings as references for cad parts, and using splines and constrictions. 
 
## CAD intro: Skateboard
In this assignment we were tasked to follow the instructions to create a skateboard in onshape.
### Screenshots of skateboard:

![SkateboardBOTTOM](https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/CAD/DripboardSS2.png)
I added a few personal twists in mine but successfully completed the lesson. In this assignment I learned about bends, breaks, and expanded my knowledge on splines.This assignment heavily helped me with upcoming things such as the pumpkin challenge.
