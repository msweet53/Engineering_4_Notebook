# Python
This year I am working on scripting python using a raspberry pi. Below you will find my completed scripting challenges this year. 

## hello world
The purpose of this assignmet was to print "Hello world." in a loop 5 times. I completed the assignement succesfully and learned more about for loops.

## Python Program 01, Calculator
The purpose of this assigment was to input variables, and use function to calculate some things. I learned how to use inputs, had some practice with functions, and learned alot of foundation material for the next assignments.

## Python Program 02, Quadratic Solver
The purpose of this assignemtn was to input variables for a, b, and c in relation to a quadratic function, and have it solve for the roots of the function. I learned a lot about functions in this assignment.

## Python Program 03, Strings and Loops
The purpose of this assignment was to create a script that broke a string into individual letters with a "-" replacing breaks. I learned a lot about strings and implementing loops into other code. The goal was to get it into as few lines as possible, and I got it into 3.

## Python Challenge, Hangman Script
The purpose of this assignment was to create a working hangman game script. I put together all of the fundamentals that I had learned in the previous assignments and larned some more about functions, printing strings, and other various scripting elements. 
### Code:
https://github.com/msweet53/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/hangman_script.py
