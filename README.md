# Python
This year I am working on scripting python using a raspberry pi. Below you will find my completed scripting challenges this year. 

## hello world
The purpose of this assignmet was to print "Hello world." in a loop 5 times. I completed the assignement succesfully and learned more about for loops.

## Python Program 01, Calculator
The purpose of this assigment was to input variables, and use function to calculate some things. I learned how to use inputs, had some practice with functions, and learned alot of foundation material for the next assignments.

## Python Program 02, Quadratic Solver
The purpose of this assignemtn was to input variables for a, b, and c in relation to a quadratic function, and have it solve for the roots of the function. I learned a lot about functions in this assignment.

## Python Program 03, Strings and Loops
The purpose of this assignment was to create a script that broke a string into individual letters with a "-" replacing breaks. I learned a lot about strings and implementing loops into other code. The goal was to get it into as few lines as possible, and I got it into 3.

## Python Challenge, Hangman Script
The purpose of this assignment was to create a working hangman game script. I put together all of the fundamentals that I had learned in the previous assignments and larned some more about functions, printing strings, and other various scripting elements. 
### Code:

# OnShape CAD
This year we are lucky enough to use an amazing program called OnShape for our CAD work. This is a completely cloud based CAD software. These are my CAD assignments for the 2021-22 year.

## CAD Test, Swing Arm
In this assignment, we were tasked to design a part in onshpae only using drawings as a reference. We then tested the mass of the object to see if we designed the part correctly. I was successful in all stages of the OnShape challenge. Through this assignment I learned a lot about how powerful drawings are (when dimensioned) and learned how to use them as reliable references.

## Extra CAD test, Tool Block
In this optional assignment, we were tasked to create 3 variations of an object based on dimensioned drawings alone. We tested whether our parts were correct or not by measuring the mass of the part with a given material. I succesfully completed all of them. In this assignment I expanded my knowledge on using drawings as references for cad parts, and using splines and constrictions.

## CAD intro: Skateboard
In this assignment we were tasked to follow the instructions to create a skateboard in onshape. I added a few personal twists in mine but successfully completed the lesson. In this assignment I learned about bends, breaks, and expanded my knowledge on splines.
